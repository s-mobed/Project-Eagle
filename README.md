# Project-Eagle
This code was written to help process genotyping data produced by the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow (LLiG). The code processes raw data files produced by the Taq-man Reflex assays which targets 4 loci on the CoV-Sars-2 viral genome, the samples used are from the positive samples tested within the LLiG. The code then produces reports following the guidelines provided the DHSC of the UK government.
The first report states the if the loci is mutant or wild-type for each given sample
The second report states which variant of covid-19 from the positive samples by combining the resuls from each loci and using a decision tree to determine the variant.
The third report states amount of each variant that is currently being tested for, B.1','B.1.1.7','B.1.351','P.1','A.23.1','B.1.617.2'.
